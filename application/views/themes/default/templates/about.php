Or perhaps you love listening to classical music and would like to delve more into its traditions.</div>
	<div class="red_highlight_text">We love classical music, and would like to share this love with you.</div>
	<div class="about_body_text">We decided that the most enjoyable and practical way to make classical music more engaging to everyone would simply be through listening to it - with real-time programme notes. So sit back, relax and enjoy the music.</div>
