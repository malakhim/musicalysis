<div id="intro">Overview:</div>
    The overture was composed by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky over the course of 6 weeks. It premiered at the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour on 20 August 1882, in commemoration of Russia’s defense against Napolean’s army in 1812. <br/>
    <div class="highlighted-text">Trivia:</div> In order to fire the cannon shots safely and precisely, a live performance would require well-trained military crew using either a modern cannon, or the use of sixteen pieces of muzzle-loading 1800s artillery, since it would be impossible to attain all sixteen shots within the two-minute span with the latter.
